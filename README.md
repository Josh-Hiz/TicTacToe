# TicTacToe implementation in Java
## Uses:
- Java Swing and Java AWT for UI
## Quick Notes:
- This project in particular is split into 2, specifically I made both a GUI version and a version of TicTacToe that can be played with 2 people in the terminal/console when run (obviously the person needs to be with you when you play).
- The console version can be found within the *console* folder, and you can run *TTT.java*
- Important to note my implementation IS COLOR BASED, meaning Orange squares are X's, and Blue squares are O's, I used this approach to learn more about JPanels
